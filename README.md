# Face-Recognition-Based-Attendance-System-Using-Deep-Learning
The Face Recognition Based Attendance System is an advanced application that utilizes deep learning techniques to automate the process of taking attendance. This system leverages facial recognition technology to identify and verify individuals, making the attendance process more efficient and accurate. The application is built using Python and the Tkinter library for the user interface, with the Local Binary Patterns Histograms (LBPH) algorithm implemented for face recognition.

# Features

Admin Features

Add New Students: Admin can add new student profiles with their facial data to the system.

Manage Attendance Records: View, edit, and manage attendance logs.

Generate Reports: Generate attendance reports for specified periods.



User Features

Automated Attendance: Studentsâ€™ attendance is automatically marked when their faces are recognized by the system.

Real-time Recognition: Quick and accurate face recognition to ensure seamless attendance marking.


# Technical Features

Face Detection and Recognition: Uses LBPH algorithm to detect and recognize faces from the camera feed.

User Interface: Developed using Python Tkinter, providing a simple and intuitive interface for both admin and users.

Database Integration: Stores student profiles and attendance records in a database for easy retrieval and management.


# Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

User Interface: Tkinter

Face Recognition Algorithm: Local Binary Patterns Histograms (LBPH)

Database: CSV File
