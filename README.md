# Face-Recognition-Based-Attendance-System-Using-Deep-Learning
The Face Recognition Based Attendance System is an advanced application that utilizes deep learning techniques to automate the process of taking attendance. This system leverages facial recognition technology to identify and verify individuals, making the attendance process more efficient and accurate. The application is built using Python and the Tkinter library for the user interface, with the Local Binary Patterns Histograms (LBPH) algorithm implemented for face recognition.

# TECHNOLOGY USED

1) tkinter for whole GUI
2) OpenCV for taking images and face recognition (cv2.face.LBPHFaceRecognizer_create())
3) CSV, Numpy, Pandas, datetime etc. for other purposes.

# FEATURES

1) Easy to use with interactive GUI support.
2) Password protection for new person registration.
3) Creates/Updates CSV file for details of students on registration.
4) Creates a new CSV file everyday for attendance and marks attendance with proper date and time.
5) Displays live attendance updates for the day on the main screen in tabular format with Id, name, date and time.


# Technical Features

Face Detection and Recognition: Uses LBPH algorithm to detect and recognize faces from the camera feed.

User Interface: Developed using Python Tkinter, providing a simple and intuitive interface for both admin and users.

Database Integration: Stores student profiles and attendance records in a database for easy retrieval and management.
